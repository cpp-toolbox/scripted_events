# blender marker exporter
This blender addon was created to help export animations from blender so taht they can be used with the scripted event code

- In the timeline or dopesheet press `m` in blender to create a marker, and then press `F2` to rename the marker
- For one time events, you should specify them with `*event_name`
- If the event has a duration then you can do `>event_name` to mark the start event and then use `<event_name` to mark the end of the event
